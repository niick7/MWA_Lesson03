Instructions

1- Create an Express Mongoose API application to get all games and get One game using all the checking and hardening we covered in class.

2-  Create a headless application to work with SchoolDB. But now add address as a sub-document to the student and add API for address. (your API should only do getall and getOne).

Example of API usage for question 2

api/students/
api/students/1537
api/students/1537/addresses
api/students/1537/addresses/1123

3- Think of a MEAN application that you wish to create. As an answer to this question just provide a title for your application.
